# Understanding ROS 2 GetParameters
> A parameter is a configuration value of a node. You can think of parameters as node settings.
> A ndoe can store parameters as integers, floats, booleans, strings and lists.
> In ROS 2, each node maintains its own parameters.
> All parameters are dynamically reconfigurable, and built off of ROS 2 services.
