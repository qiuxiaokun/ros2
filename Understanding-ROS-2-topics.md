# Understanding ROS 2 topics
> ROS 2 breaks complex systems down into many modular nodes. Topics are a vital element of the ROS\
        graph that act as a bus for nodes to exchange messages. A node may publish data to any number\
        of topics and simultaneously have subscriptions to any number of topics. Topics are one of\
        the import ways that data moves between node, and therefore between different parts of the\
        system.
